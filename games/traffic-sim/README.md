# Signal Stream

A self-contained one-way traffic simulation with a 30s green / 3s yellow / 30s red cycle. Cars arrive according to a Poisson process, queue at the stop line, accelerate smoothly when the light allows, and update live stats for queue length, average wait, and throughput. Arrival rate and cruise speed are adjustable via sliders.
